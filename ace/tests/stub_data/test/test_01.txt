Gamma-ray burst afterglows are usually observed very early after the star has collapse in the gamma-ray wavelengths. Sometimes they have an accompanying supernovae spectrum, which is used as evidence that they are associated to supernovae, and thus are related to core collapse stars. Not all gamma-ray bursts have this feature, however.
